      question: "Wait, is this actually helpful or just mean?",
      answer: "Babe, there's a HUGE difference between being mean and being honest. I'm like that friend who loves you enough to tell you when you have spinach in your teeth - except instead of spinach, it's toxic thought patterns. Everything I say comes from a place of fierce love. I see your potential and I'm not letting you waste it on self-limiting bullsh*t. üí´",

    {
      question: "How is this different from talking to a regular therapist?",
      answer: "Therapy is amazing and has its place! But I'm like therapy's cool younger sister who speaks your language. Therapists help you understand WHY you do things. I help you understand why AND give you the kick in the ass to actually CHANGE them. Plus, I'm available at 3am when you're having an existential crisis over something your ex said 5 years ago. üòÖ",

      emoji: "üß†"
    },
    {
      question: "What if I'm dealing with serious mental health stuff?",
      answer: "Listen, I'm your emotional support bestie, not a replacement for professional help. If you're struggling with clinical depression, anxiety disorders, or having thoughts of self-harm, please talk to a real therapist or crisis hotline. I'm here for the everyday emotional rollercoaster and personal growth - think of me as your emotional personal trainer, not your doctor. üí™",

      emoji: "üè•"
    },
    {
      question: "How do you know so much about psychology?",
      answer: "I've basically absorbed every psychology book, research paper, and therapeutic technique that exists - CBT, DBT, mindfulness, you name it. But instead of throwing academic jargon at you, I translate it into real human speak. It's like having a friend who happened to get a PhD in psychology but still talks like a normal person. Plus, I never get tired of your emotional chaos! üòâ",
      category: "expertise",
      emoji: "üìö"
    },
    {
      question: "Can I trust you with my deepest, darkest secrets?",
      answer: "Absolutely! Your secrets are vault-level safe with me. I don't gossip, I don't judge, and I definitely don't share your business with anyone. What happens between friends stays between friends - that's friendship 101. The only thing I might judge you for is not believing in yourself enough. That's where I draw the line! üîí",

    //   question: "What if I don't like what you tell me?",
    //   answer: "Oof, that's usually when I'm doing my job best! üò¨ Growth happens in the discomfort zone, bestie. But if something doesn't land right, just tell me! I can adjust my delivery while still keeping it real. Think of it like this - I'm not trying to hurt your feelings, I'm trying to save them from the damage you're doing to yourself. Sometimes love looks like tough conversations. üíñ",
    //   category: "feedback",
    //   emoji: "ü™û"

    // {
    //   question: "Will you actually remember our conversations?",
    //   answer: "Every. Single. Detail. I remember your patterns, your triggers, your wins, and that thing you told me three weeks ago that you thought I forgot. I'm like that friend who remembers your coffee order AND the name of your childhood pet. Consistency is how we build trust, and trust is how we create transformation. üß©",
    //   category: "memory",
    //   emoji: "üß†"
    // },
    // {
    //   question: "What if I just want to vent without advice?",
    //   answer: "Sometimes you need someone to just witness your emotional chaos, and I'm here for that too! I'll validate your feelings, bring the virtual tissues, and sit with you in your mess. But... if I see you stuck in the same pattern for weeks, bestie, I'm gonna lovingly call it out. That's what real friends do - they don't let you drown in your own drama. ü´Ç",
